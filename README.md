# More JourneyMap Icons

This is a resource pack that contains additional icons to use as JourneyMap waypoints, also replacing the default icons to keep the icon resolution consistent.

This pack uses Vanilla map icons as a base, but with some additional icons added and some modifications made to the existing icons.

Set the waypoint color to white in order to use colorful icons without tinting them.
