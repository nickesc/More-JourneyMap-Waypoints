### Overview

*More JourneyMap Icons* is an addon resource pack for [JourneyMap](https://modrinth.com/mod/journeymap) that contains additional icons to use as waypoints, while also replacing the default icons to keep the style and resolution consistent.

This pack uses Vanilla map icons as a base, but with some additional icons added and some modifications made to the existing icons.

Set the waypoint color to white in order to use colorful icons without tinting them.

### Icons

The following icons are available for use in the pack:
